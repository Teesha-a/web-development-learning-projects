<p>Hello! I'm a passionate self-taught programmer and a final-year BCA student with a strong foundation in Python, C, and C++. I enjoy building full-stack web applications and working on data-driven projects.</p>

 <p> My tech stack includes PYTHON, MySQL, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB, FLASK, and Full-Stack Web Development.
  <br/>
   Some of my recent projects include:
   <br>
   <br>
  

 * A receipt and invoice digitization system using Python, Flask, and MySQL.<br/>
 * A  Udemy Courses Data Analysis Project using Python,Pandas and Matplotlib .</p>
 <p> My goal is to collaborate on meaningful projects and land a tech role in a leading company or a growing startup where I can learn, contribute, and grow.
